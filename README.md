# Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

## Overview
End-to-end machine learning pipeline predicting loan default probability on real-world applications from the [Home Credit Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). Target variable is binary — 1 indicates default, 0 indicates no default — with significant class imbalance of 8.1% default rate.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Bureau aggregation — engineered applicant-level features 
  from bureau.csv and bureau_balance.csv
- Domain cleaning — replaced known placeholders (DAYS_EMPLOYED=365243),
  impossible values, and XNA categories
- Missingness flags — created binary indicators for informative 
  missing patterns (EXT_SOURCE, building info)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Financial ratios** — debt-to-income, annuity-to-income, 
  credit-to-goods, bureau debt burden
- **Bureau features** — total active debt, closed loan count, 
  past default rate, delinquency rate
- **External scores** — EXT_SOURCE mean and minimum across 
  three credit bureau sources

### 3. Preprocessing Pipeline
- Stratified train/validation/test split
- Median imputation 
- Outlier capping at 99th percentile 
- Ordinal encoding 
- One hot encoding 
- StandardScaler 

### 4. Class Imbalance Handling
- class_weight='balanced' for sklearn models
- scale_pos_weight for XGBoost
- Primary evaluation metric: ROC-AUC

### 5. Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold (5 folds)
- RandomizedSearchCV for tree-based models
- Primary scoring metric: roc_auc
